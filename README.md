## Overview
HealthStat Solutions, a company specializing in healthcare analytics. We have two datasets: 'Patient Medical Records' and 'Hospital Treatment Details'. The 'Patient Medical Records' dataset contains detailed information on patients, including their age, gender, blood type, diagnosis, treatments, admission and discharge dates, and total bills. The 'Hospital Treatment Details' dataset provides insights into the hospitals treating these patients, including the treating doctor, room number, daily costs, treatment types, and recovery ratings.

In a healthcare industry that relies heavily on data to make informed decisions for patient care and hospital management. The task is to analyze these datasets, uncovering trends and insights that could improve patient outcomes and optimize hospital operations.

## Objective
Our objective is to leverage Power BI for a deep dive into the provided healthcare datasets. This task encompasses meticulous data cleaning and sophisticated data modeling, utilizing DAX for advanced analytics. Our goal is to create a comprehensive, interactive dashboard in Power BI that presents a cohesive narrative of the healthcare data. This dashboard should serve as a tool to uncover and visualize important trends, such as the interplay between patient demographics and treatment outcomes, cost implications of various medical procedures, and overall hospital performance metrics. Our analysis will provide invaluable insights, aiding healthcare providers in enhancing patient care and operational efficiency, and positioning HealthStat Solutions at the forefront of healthcare analytics.

### Key Insights

* There are 5 Hospitals and maximum  number of patients treated in Green Valley Medical Center i.e 21.62% of all patients.
* Average treatment cost per patient lie around 11k.
* Majority patients i.e 21.9% out of all are suffering from Diabetes
* count of Senier Patients are high in all gender.
* Count of patients increase above 60 between March and September
* Average recovery Rating of Counselling is high and of surgery is least.
* As stay-up period decreases recovery rating increases.

# Suggestions
* There is negative corelation between recovery rating and stay_up period, so there is requirement of extra care for longer stay_up period.
